### FEAScript: A JavaScript Finite Element Simulation Library

<a href="https://feascript.com/" target="_blank">FEAScript</a> is a lightweight finite element simulation library built in JavaScript. It empowers users to perform simulations for physics and engineering applications in both browser-based and server-side environments.

FEAScript consists of several components:

- The main library, [FEAScript core](https://github.com/FEAScript/FEAScript), distributed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/FEAScript/FEAScript-core/blob/main/LICENSE).
- The [FEAScript Platform](https://github.com/FEAScript/FEAScript-platform), a browser-based visual editor, also released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/FEAScript/FEAScript-platform/blob/main/LICENSE).
- Examples in multiple formats:
  - [Node.js implementations](https://github.com/FEAScript/FEAScript-core/tree/main/examples), showcasing direct API usage.
  - [XML examples](https://github.com/FEAScript/FEAScript-platform/tree/main/examples), for use with the [FEAScript Platform](https://platform.feascript.com/) visual editor.
  - [Scribbler examples](https://github.com/nikoscham/FEAScript-Scribbler-examples), designed to run on [Scribbler](https://scribbler.live/), an interactive JavaScript notebook tool.
- The [FEAScript website](https://github.com/FEAScript/FEAScript-website) and the [FEAScript blog](https://github.com/FEAScript/FEAScript-blog), both licensed under [CC-BY 4.0](https://github.com/FEAScript/FEAScript-website/blob/main/LICENSE).
